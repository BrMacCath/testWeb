# testWeb
## Intro
This is based off of my first attempt at a website. I tried to use hugo before Django and it was very quick to build content but when I needed to add more dynamic content it became an issue very quickly. Saying that, django was probably overkill but I have it now.

## Math 161 

This is the set of notes I made for calc 2. This app is my most current and is the best built. I have included tests from close to the start as I did not know how to build them before and I figured out a lot of things with previous apps that meant I did not make as many mistakes building this one.

## Math 340

This is the first real django app I built. It does not have testing which is a bad thing but the models were much simpler (and less useful). Still the content is there and I would know how to fix it if needs be.

## Linear 

This was just an app to get some supplemental material for the 340 course I was teaching. I didn't know how where to place this material within 340 so I moved it outside.

## Leaving Cert 

I would like there to be more online materials for the irish leaving cert maths exam. There are a couple of online resources that people pay for but I would like there to be some free ones. I thought about building it while teach Math 340 but I realised that I have no idea how to build or structure the content in an online system so I am going to practice with 340 and 161 before building it.
