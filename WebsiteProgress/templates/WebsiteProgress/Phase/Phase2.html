<h1>Using hugo and markdown</h1>

<h2>Using hugo</h2>
<p> I started using hugo. It made a lot of the functionality of the webpage easy. I will show some images below but the one downside was that it did not allow me to easily add javascript. This may have been just inexperience but I could not get that to work. Also as Hugo is a static site generator, I got the impression adding javascript to it would be difficult.</p>

<h2> Previous future goals
</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Make youtube videos that will be embedded into the webpage.</li>
    <li>Learn php so that there can be interactive lessons.</li>
    <li>Make a google doc that allows for student input.</li>
</ul>

<h2> My thoughts on these</h2>
<p>I found ways to make videos using manim and motion canvas but I think php is not the way I am going to go (for now). I can use mathJax in Javascript to get the interactivity I desire. Also I am not proficient enough at programming to take requests on the spot so I only do that before breaks/ end of semester.</p>

<h2>Possibilities</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Perhaps a random generator so the lessons will have a random element to them and be less repetitive?</li>
    <li>Learn a different language to php like javascript (can look at the js within the hugo partials).</li>
    <li>Turn the website into a personal page. Include my CV, research and github.</li>
    <li>Learn publicly. Obsidian publish?</li>
    <li>Learn to link the youtube channel to the frontpage. There was a github picture originally that worked so maybe in the partials you can do this.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Thoughts on this</h2>
<p> Even though I do not use hugo anymore, markdown is <strong>extremely</strong> useful for obsidian. I have javascript with mathJax for random number generator.</p>
