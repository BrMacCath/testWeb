<h1>Using Django and Motion Canvas</h1>

<h2>Django</h2>
<p>This allows me to use MathJax and take advantage of Javascript while still using templates.</p>
{% load static %}
<p>
    <img src="{% static 'img/p4.png' %}" alt="Picture of fourth phase" width="400px">
</p>

<h2>Motion Canvas</h2>

<p> This is what I will hopefully merge manim and Blender together for me in a convenient form. I had been using Blender for merging videos and not the 3d aspect.</p>

<h2>Downsides</h2>
<p> Lost the css styling that case with the hugo case. Got some of it back but it is taking a while.</p>
